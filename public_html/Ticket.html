                    <p><strong>1</strong><b> Decide where you are going.</b> Depending on your trip, you may have some flexibility in terms of your exact location.
                        Do some research to find the perfect destination for you.</p>
                    <ul class="ul-class">
                    <li>For example, if you want to visit the Caribbean,
                        there are over 28 island nations and 7000 individual islands to choose from.</li>
                    <li>If your destination is fixed, you may still be able to research secondary airports.
                        For example, if you are visiting your relatives in San Francisco, 
                        you could also look at flying into the nearby Oakland Airport.[1]</li>

                <p><strong>2</strong> <b>Decide when you are going.</b> With your fellow travellers, decide when you are going on your trip and for how long.
                    The more flexible you are with your dates, the easier it will be to find a deal</p>
                <ul class="ul-class">
                    <li>If your dates are not flexible or if your trip is coming up very soon, it’s best to book as soon as possible. 
                        This is especially important if you are flying during a popular period, like Thanksgiving.</li>

                <p><strong>3</strong> <b>Check if you need visas or vaccinations.</b> Some international destinations will require visitors to have special visas to come to their country or get vaccinations ahead of time. Include this in your research so you have time to make arrangements, 
                    apply for any visas and schedule travel vaccination appointments.</p>
                <ul class="ul-class">
                    <li>For the most up to date information, visit your country's travel advisory such as www.travel.gc.ca for Canadians
                        or www.travel.state.gov for Americans.</li>

                <p><strong>4</strong> <b>Consider who and what you’re traveling with.</b> For example, if you’re traveling with an infant, depending on the flight carrier, you may not need to buy a separate seat for the child. However, traveling with a baby may also mean that you will need to pack
                    extra things like a diaper bag, playpen or stroller.</p>

                <p><strong>1</strong><b> Look for flights in advance.</b> The best time to book a domestic flight is between 112 and 21 days before you depart to secure the lowest fare. 54 days before is considered the perfect time. However,
                    even booking 54 days before your trip is not guaranteed to get you the lowest fare.</p>
                <ul class="ul-class">
                    <li>If you are booking an international plane ticket, you should book as far in advance as possible, especially 
                        if your destination is smaller or only has one nearby airport.</li>
                    <li>If you are flying to a popular destination during a popular time,
                        such as Florida during Spring Break, you should book as far in advance as possible. Because this flight is popular, it is unlikely that the fare will be lowered.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="bllok">

                <p><strong>2</strong> <b>Check airfare deal websites.</b> Before booking, scan an airfare deal website, like Airfare Watch Dog, for sales. This is especially helpful if 
                    your destination or trip dates are flexible so you can take advantage of any deals.</p>
                <ul class="ul-class">
                    <li>Airlines sometimes share sales with their customers through their websites or newsletters. 
                        You can subscribe to the newsletters of your top airlines or visit their sites to search for deals.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>3</strong> <b>Enter your trip details on an aggregator site.</b> Visit an aggregator website that searches multiple airlines, like SkyScanner, Momondo or GoogleFlights, and enter your trip information. The website will be able to show you lots of flight options for your requested 
                    destination and dates that you can sort by price, airline or length of trip.</p>
                <ul class="ul-class">
                    <li>Many aggregator sites will allow you to enter multiple destinations and search flights on multiple dates. 
                        This will help you find the best deal if your trip is flexible.</li>
                    <li>If you have time, check a few aggregator websites. Some sites may advertise different prices so
                        it’s good to check around and ensure you’re getting the best deal.</li>

                <p><strong>4</strong> <b>Choose how many stops you want to make.</b> Many flights, especially to far away locations, will require you to make stopovers at airports along the way. Sometimes these will involve changing planes and going through security again. As you look at flights, remember to keep in mind how many stops you are comfortable making.
                    Also check how long and what time of day the stops are.</p>
                <ul class="ul-class">
                    <li>You may be able to find a cheaper flight if you're comfortable adding an extra stopover. However, it's important to take into account 
                        if the length and time of the stopover is worth the money you will save.</li>

                    ticket through their website, but there may be an additional service fee.</p>

                <p><strong>6</strong> <b>Choose your seat.</b> Many airlines will allow you to choose your seat at your time of booking. Ensure you choose seats for all of the passengers that you're booking airline tickets for. You can select to sit together, if there is space for your party, and whether you want an aisle, window or middle seat. You may also be able to select seat upgrades, 
                    like extra legroom, for an additional cost.</p>
                <ul class="ul-class">
                    <li>If your airline does not allow you to select your seat at the time of booking, you may be able to do it when you check in. If you have a specific seat preference or need to sit with your travel companions, for example if you're traveling with a child, 
                        call your airline to see how you can make arrangements ahead of time.</li>

                <p><strong>7</strong> <b>Choose to make it a package deal or not.</b> Towards the end of the booking process, your airline may suggest add-ons that you can book, such as hotels or car rentals. You can add these at the time 
                    of booking or book them separately from your airline ticket.</p>
                <ul class="ul-class">
                    <li>Before choosing an add-on like a hotel stay or car rental, 
                        you should do some research online and ensure your airline is offering you a good deal.</li>

                    information during your online booking, call your airline directly.</p>
                <ul class="ul-class">
                    <li>Other special accommodations may include traveling with service animals,

                    Read the fine print and decide whether or not your flight and trip require insurance.</p>
                <ul class="ul-class">
                    <li>You might be covered by insurance through your work, healthcare or credit card. It's a good idea to look into these options and compare costs if you want to

                <ul class="ul-class">

                <ul class="ul-class">
                    <li>Take bad reviews with a grain of salt. Some people will post bad reviews simply because they did not get their way

                    <li>Pay attention to how many good and bad reviews an agent got.

                <ul class="ul-class">

If you are flexible with nearby destinations, multiple stopovers or similar dates, ensure you tell your travel agent that information. Also, let your travel agent
