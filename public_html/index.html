    <h2>What is Simplicity?</h2>
    <p>Simplicity is the state or quality of being simple. Something easy to understand or explain seems simple, in contrast to something complicated.
      Alternatively, as Herbert A. Simon suggests, something is simple or complex depending on the way we choose to describe it.
      In some uses, the label "simplicity" can imply beauty, purity, or clarity.
      In other cases, the term may occur with negative connotations to suggest, a deficit or insufficiency of nuance
      or of complexity of a thing, relative to what one supposes as required.</p>
